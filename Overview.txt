INITIAL RUN (GOOGLE COLLAB)

APPLICATION_TYPE cutoff = 10
CLASSIFICATION cutoff = 100
layer1 = 7 : activation function = relu
layer2 = 14 : activation function = relu

Loss: 0.5534879565238953, Accuracy: 0.7300291657447815

A loss value of 55 indicates that the model can be further optimized.
The accuracy percent shows that 73% of the model's predicted values align with the true values in the original dataset.


OPTIMIZATION 2: 

APPLICATION_TYPE cutoff = 300
CLASSIFICATION cutoff = 150
layer1 = 7 : activation function = relu
layer2 = 14 : activation function = relu
layer3 = 21 : activation function = relu

Loss: 0.9845994710922241, Accuracy: 0.5678133964538574
A loss value of 98 indicates that the model can be further optimized.
The accuracy percent shows that 56% of the model's predicted values align with the true values in the original dataset.


OPTIMIZATION 3:

Loss: 0.5520119667053223, Accuracy: 0.7294460535049438

A loss value of 55 indicates that the model can be further optimized.
The accuracy percent shows that 72.9% of the model's predicted values align with the true values in the original dataset.


---After all 3 attempts, I was not successful in reaching the goal of 75% accurracy. However, I noticed that during the training, there were some results that came close to 80%, but the final result did not reach 75%.---
